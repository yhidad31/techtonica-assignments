Event Recommender System
This is a very basic event recommender system that allows people to add and delete their names and interests, view events, filter through events based on date, price, event type and title.
Motivation
This project exists as a practice in object oriented programming. I hope to improve upon it by adding some kind of database when I learn how to do so that the site can become more functional.
Build status
Build status of incomplete, as I want to incorporate a database when that is introduced into our curriculum
 
Code style

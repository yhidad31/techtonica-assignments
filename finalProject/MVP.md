**MVP:**

Vital health information is often passed from patient or caregiver to doctor in a slow and inefficient way. Health data such as blood pressure is logged by a patient or caregiver on paper and then brought to the doctor, however logging this information on paper can be difficult to keep track of. What if there was a more streamlined approach to health monitoring? This software will allow a device to communicate vitals from the patient directly to the doctor. The app will alert the hospital if there are any dangerous metrics reported. The patient will be able to stop the sharing of information whenever they please, and will be able to pick and choose the information which is sent to the doctor when they sign up. At the very least, the app will track heart rate, number of steps, sleep, and blood pressure.

**Features to come:**

An alert to patientâ€™s hospital if any of the reported metrics are dangerous, or in need of further observation.

**Stretch goals:**

I would like to integrate features which allow reporting from devices such as an insulin pump, pacemaker, or ventilator. Later on I would like to integrate features that allow the patient to access their medical records on their own and download immunization records and such.
